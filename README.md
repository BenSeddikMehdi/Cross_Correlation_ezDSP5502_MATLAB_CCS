# Cross_Correlation_ezDSP5502_MATLAB_CCS


First of all, to implement the Cross-Correlation onto ezDSP5502 there are a few steps that we ought to pass through : 

1- Generate two signals over MATLAB, one is a pure sinus and the second is shifted with 2Ï€.

2- Store the values of the two signals into CSV files.

3- Write the code of the Cross-Correlation in C language.

4- Run the whole script of the Cross-Correlation CCS project onto CCSv9.
